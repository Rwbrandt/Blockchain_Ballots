 Imagine a world in which something so dramatic, say a pandemic, happens and makes it unsafe for people to leave their homes for regular activities?  In important years there is still a need for democratic actions to continue moving forward as a nation, in other words, VOTING!  For everything from union collective bargaining, local elections, to presidential elections, voting is a key instrument in improving the world around us.  What has been created and laid out here provides a way for anonymous voting stored within a blockchain that provides security, speed, and confirmation of completion within moments of casting the vote!
